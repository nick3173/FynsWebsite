		<h1>Hello Delfinito</h1>
		<h5>Date: December 11, 2023</h5>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remeber, this fateful date of the 11th of December before the year 2023 ends! I have to say that the best way to study HTML is to actually make a website that talks about HTML.This is not just an ordinary website but also a historical note that is intended for the future <strong>YOU</strong> to read and remember the struggles that I have to go through just to learn this new talent. If you have masterred this language, I have to say congratulations! Your hardwork and dedication paid of.
		</p>
		
		<h2>My Understanding About HTML</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I know is that I have made several years of attempts in learning this language. But I always fail to grow or proceed to the next level. That is because I have financial problems and I have to work, I have some questions that is left unanswered, and there is absolutely no community I can turn to and ask to whenever I got confused. After years and years of attempts I always failed to study this new language. And then I realized that it has been 23 years already that I have been working as a call center agent. My life was a major growth from being unemployed working as a street sweeper and then as a call center agent at the age of 18th of year 2010 I was just a highschool graduate student back then. Learning about HTML that talks about your life brings meaning in the application of this language so it is worthwhile to learn then. So at present, the call center industry is one hell of a ride but not life is at a stnadstill. I can no longer grow and I can no longer provide to my family. So this circumstances remains the catalyst again that brings me back to learning unique skills or talents. This skills are ultra rare and in demand and is not accessible to the public and of course fetch a hefty amount.
		</p>
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML is the text or message of the website. Without it a reader can hardly distinguish what sets your site apart from the billions of website accross the world. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of course an HTML to be able to function well must act like a system as if a human body. It must have a <strong>Head</strong> which we call the &lt;heading&gt;. The <strong>body</strong> which we call the &lt;body&gt; that talks about the content of the website and finally the <strong>feet</strong> which we call the &lt;footer&gt;. Each of which serves a unique purpose for the system to stand.
		</p>
		<h2>Special characters</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of special characters in the programmings space is that, the computer is interpreting some characters in order for it to work properly as a network but not as a text that we humans can read. For example the <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> cannot be written manually as it appears on the text. This is because the <strong>&lt;</strong> symble when written on this website is not recognize by the computer. The same way with the <strong>&gt;</strong> and the <strong>&amp;</strong> symbol. There is also a unique feature about html is that it cannot understand space in the code. No matter how many space we placed in each text, it read it only as plain text. So in order for a paragraph to appear as if a paragraph we put in a special code called <strong>non breaking space</strong> or as seen as <strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>. Boy, I was having a headache about this topic before. hahahahahah
		</p>
		
		<h2>Text Formatting</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time: 11:33 PM of December 11. This will be the last topic for the day before I head to work and think only about work. Text formatting talks about text stylling and transforming a simple text into a specific purpose within the html space. There are several topics that we will specifically discrive bellow.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Heading</strong> - his is the heading this is how it looks like bellow:
		</p> 
		
		<h1>H1</h1>
		<h2>H1</h2>
		<h3>H1</h3>
		<h4>H1</h4>
		<h5>H1</h5>
		<h6>H1</h6>
		
		<h2>The types of blocks</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Paragraph</strong> - Paragraph tag <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> functions as a block aside from closing in the messages inside it. Each time we make a paragraph, means that a new line will be added below the paragraph. It is called a block type elements.
		</p> 
		
		<p>
			Just like this one.
		</p> 
		<p>
			And this one.
		</p> 
		<p>
			<strong>2. The &lt;span&gt;</strong> tag  - Acts the same way as the Paragraph tag as it incloses the messages inside it. But the key distiction about it as compare to the paragraph tag is that it does not add another space even having two span tags within a paragraph. <span>&lt;span&gt;You are actually reading it already and indeed I am adding the span tag within this sentence already &lt;span/&gt;</span>. <span>&lt;span&gt;But notice that it did not make another paragraph below. Interesting right? &lt;span/&gt;</span>. So this is the non block type of element.
		</p>
		<p>
			3. The &lt;<strong>a</strong>&gt; tag - Is the only think that best discrive the HTML's ultimate power. The ability to jump between time and space and connect one document to another no matter where you are staying in this world. I am blessed to have witnessed this power from God and I will use this talent to grow it and make it productive for the glorry of God. The <strong>A</strong> tag really is just the link.It stands for anchor. A path or door is anchored within this aread so that whenever you press this, you will be transported to a different dimention. It works perfectlly well in text and information. If only it works the same way as instant transmission we often see in anime. Hahahaahaha
		</p>
		<p>
			This is what an &lt;a&gt; tag looks like in a form of an underlined blue link. Please click this <a href="http://google.com">link</a> to teleport to the 4th dimention.
