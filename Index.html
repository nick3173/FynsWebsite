    <h1>Hello Me!</h1>
    <p>Today December 10 of 2023, I am writing to my future self. Good job that you finally have taken the first step in achieving your goal. Just stay focus and learn new lesson everyday. Remember to compare your latest self to your previous self as of writing.

    <h2>Remember this</h2>
<p>This is just a blank website with no actual direction ahahhahahaha.I wanted to test if by adding this line break <br/> will make this second line of text adjusted below. The line beark itself works but the space is not very apparent.How about we add two line breaks <br/> <br/> hahhahahahah let us see the difference</p>
